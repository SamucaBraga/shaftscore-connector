# Kelly Odds (Football)

### Significance

The value reflected by the Kelly odds represents the market compensation risk of the odds, i.e., the compensation difference between the dynamic market and the previously established loss ratio.

### Overview

The Kelly odds are calculated as the product of the company's instant odds and the corresponding market average win/tie/negative probability.

## Kelly Odds Formula

- **Win**:  
  `Win Odds × Average Win Rate in Europe`
- **Flat (Draw)**:  
  `Flat Odds × European Average Flat Rate`
- **Negative (Loss)**:  
  `Loss Odds × European Average Negative Rate`

## European Average Win/Tie/Loss Rate Formula

### Example: Average Win Rate in Europe

`Average Win Rate in Europe = (p31 + p32 + ... + p3n) / n`

- `p31`: Main win rate of the first company
- `p3n`: Main win rate of the nth company

## Win/Tie/Loss Rate Formula

### Example: Europe’s Main Win Rate

`Main Win Rate = Return Rate / Winning Odds`

---

## Return Rate Formula

`Return Rate = (Winning Odds × Flat Odds × Negative Odds) / (Winning Odds × Flat Odds + Flat Odds × Negative Odds + Winning Odds × Negative Odds)`
